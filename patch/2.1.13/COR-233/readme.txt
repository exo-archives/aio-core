Configuration changes

Configuration changes:

    * By default, group and user DN keys are in lower case, but it is possible to configure via initialization params if needed:

      <value-param>
        <name>ldap.userDN.key</name>
        <description>The key used to compose user DN</description>^
        <value>cn</value>
      </value-param>
      <value-param>
        <name>ldap.groupDN.key</name>
        <description>The key used to compose group DN</description>^
        <value>ou</value>
      </value-param>

Will previous configuration continue to work?

    * Yes
